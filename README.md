# Field Trip Agent

Build and deploy a **durable AI agent** with the [Flue Framework](https://flueframework.com)
on **Cloudflare Workers**, backed by **Durable Objects** for persistence and recovery.

This repo is set up for the **Cloudflare Connect 2026 · Build It** session. It holds
the starter code, a working agent at every checkpoint, and a skill for your coding agent.

- **Workshop guide (start here):** <https://flue-field-day-workshop.steph.workers.dev/>.
  It covers setup and pre-work, plus a step-by-step walkthrough of every checkpoint.
- **Live demo:** <https://field-trip-agent.omkk.workers.dev/>

> **Using a coding agent** (OpenCode, Claude Code, Cursor, ...)? Point it at this
> README and the skill in [`.agents/skills/build-field-trip-agent/`](.agents/skills/build-field-trip-agent/SKILL.md).
> Rules for agents are at the [bottom of this file](#for-coding-agents).

## What you'll learn

| Concept | How you'll see it |
|---|---|
| Creating an agent | An agent *is* a function that returns its instructions, marked with `'use agent'` |
| The Flue hook model | `useModel`, `usePersistentState`, `useTool`, `useSubagent`, `useSandbox`: the agent re-renders before every model call |
| Tools that call external APIs | `defineTool` + [valibot](https://valibot.dev) schemas → Open-Meteo and Wikipedia |
| Sub-agent delegation | A `venue-scout` sub-agent with its own tool, its own model, and a fresh context |
| Sandbox strategies | No sandbox → in-memory virtual sandbox → Cloudflare Computer → Cloudflare Sandbox container (built) |
| Deploy, test, iterate | `vite dev` → `wrangler deploy` → test live → read traces |
| Durable Objects | One Durable Object per conversation; the brief survives sleeps and redeploys |

## The agent: `FieldTrip`

You tell it about an offsite (**city, dates, headcount, budget, interests**) and it:

1. Saves the **trip brief** and remembers it across messages.
2. Checks the **weather** for your dates.
3. Finds places nearby and asks its **`venue-scout`** sub-agent to assess them
   (activities, visit length, weather dependency), then matches them to the forecast.
4. Writes an **itinerary** to `itinerary.md` in its sandbox.

It runs on [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) through the
Worker's `AI` binding, and every external API it calls is free and keyless, so
**no API keys are needed**.

| API | Used for |
|---|---|
| [Open-Meteo Geocoding](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/geocoding-api) | city → latitude/longitude |
| [Open-Meteo Forecast](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) | daily forecast, up to 16 days ahead |
| [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Geosearch) | places near a location + summaries |

## Checkpoints

The session is split into checkpoints. Each one is a **git tag** (`cp0`…`cp6`)
and a **branch** (`cp/1-hello-agent`…) with working code, so you can always
catch up. `cp6` is the final state of the agent.

| Tag | Branch | Checkpoint | You build | You verify |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cp0` | `main` | **Starter** | — | `npm run check`, `/api/ping` → `pong` |
| `cp1` | `cp/1-hello-agent` | **Hello agent + first deploy** | `src/agents/field-trip.ts`, mount it in `src/app.ts`, add a Durable Object migration | agent replies locally **and** on your `workers.dev` URL |
| `cp2` | `cp/2-hooks-state` | **Hooks + persistent state** | `usePersistentState('brief')` + a `save_trip_brief` tool | a second message remembers your headcount |
| `cp3` | `cp/3-api-tools` | **Tools calling external APIs** | `geocode_city`, `get_forecast` (Open-Meteo) | a weather question shows tool calls in the conversation |
| `cp4` | `cp/4-subagent` | **Sub-agent delegation** | Wikipedia tools; a `venue-scout` sub-agent with its own tool and model | the parent finds places, calls `task`, and combines the scout's assessment with the weather |
| `cp5` | `cp/5-sandbox` | **Sandbox** | a Cloudflare Sandbox container per conversation | the agent writes `itinerary.md` and reads it back |
| `cp6` | `cp/6-iterate-observe` | **Iterate + observe** | open the sandbox only when needed, turn on logs and traces, redeploy | new behavior live; traces in the Cloudflare dashboard |

### Fell behind? Catch up in one command

```bash
git stash                      # keep your work, if you want it
git fetch --all --tags
git switch -c my-cp3 cp3       # start from any checkpoint tag
npm install                    # later checkpoints may add dependencies
```

Then re-run that checkpoint's verify step. Or ask your coding agent: *"catch me up
to checkpoint 3"*. The skill knows how.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run check` | Checks the Node version, dependencies, and `wrangler whoami` |
| `npm run dev` | Local dev server on `http://localhost:5173` (runs in local `workerd`) |
| `npm run build` | Build the Worker into `dist/` |
| `npm run deploy` | Build and deploy to `https://field-trip-agent.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev` |
| `npm run smoke -- <base-url> <id> "<message>"` | Send a message to the agent and print its reply |

### Talking to your agent

**In the browser:** open <http://localhost:5173> (or your `workers.dev` URL). The
chat UI streams replies live, shows every tool call as an expandable chip, and
has example prompts for each checkpoint (click one, then **Send**). The conversation
id is in the URL (`/?id=…`): bookmark it, open several conversations in tabs, or
open a smoke conversation with `/?id=offsite-1`. **New conversation** starts a fresh
Durable Object.

**From the terminal:**

Every conversation lives at `/agents/field-trip/<id>`. The `<id>` is anything you
choose. Use the same id to continue a conversation.

```bash
# easiest
npm run smoke -- http://localhost:5173 offsite-1 "Plan an offsite in Lisbon for 12 people"

# or by hand: send (returns 202 immediately) ...
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/agents/field-trip/offsite-1 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"kind":"user","body":"Plan an offsite in Lisbon for 12 people"}'

# ... then read the conversation
curl 'http://localhost:5173/agents/field-trip/offsite-1?view=history'
```

Swap `http://localhost:5173` for your `workers.dev` URL to talk to the live agent.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `npm run check` says not logged in | `npx wrangler login`, then re-run the check |
| `Port 5173 is already in use` | Another dev server (maybe another project) is running. Stop it, or `npm run dev -- --port 5180` and smoke against `http://localhost:5180` |
| Dev server: "Cloudflare plugin is not receiving Flue's Worker configuration" | `vite.config.ts` must use `cloudflare({ config: flueWorkerConfig() })` |
| Deploy fails asking for a `workers.dev` subdomain | Open **Workers & Pages** in the dashboard once to create it |
| Deploy fails with a Durable Object / migration error | Every agent needs a `new_sqlite_classes` migration in `wrangler.jsonc` (see cp1) |
| `cloudflare/...` model errors under `flue run` | Workers AI models only run under `npm run dev` or deployed, not `flue run` |
| POST returns `202` but no reply yet | Replies are async. Poll `GET .../<id>?view=history` or use `npm run smoke` |
| Files the agent wrote are gone | The container was replaced (redeploy) or slept (~10 min idle); persistent state is what survives |
| Traces show one short `chat` span and no tool spans | Flue 2.1.x is installed. This repo pins 2.0.0: `npm install`, then redeploy |
| Stuck? | `git switch -c fresh cpN` and carry on |

## For coding agents

You are helping a workshop attendee build this project checkpoint by checkpoint
(`cp0`…`cp6`; `cp6` is the final checkpoint).

**Load the skill first:** `.agents/skills/build-field-trip-agent/SKILL.md`. It
contains the verified code and verify command for every checkpoint
(`references/checkpoints/cpN-*.md`), a Flue cheatsheet, deploy notes, and
troubleshooting.

**Workflow:** detect the current checkpoint (`git describe --tags`, or inspect
`src/`) → implement only the *next* checkpoint → run its verify step → report.
If the attendee is behind, offer `git switch -c <name> cpN` instead of
hand-writing several checkpoints at once.

**Rules:**

1. **Adding an agent is a triple:** the `'use agent'` file, the `app.route(...)`
   mount in `src/app.ts`, and a uniquely tagged `new_sqlite_classes` migration in
   `wrangler.jsonc`. The Durable Object class is `Flue<Name>Agent`
   (`FieldTrip` → `FlueFieldTripAgent`). Append migrations; never rewrite existing ones.
2. **`flue()` comes before `cloudflare()`** in `vite.config.ts`, and
   `cloudflare()` receives `{ config: flueWorkerConfig() }` (from `@flue/vite`).
   Keep `flue({ providers: ['cloudflare'] })` unless you add another model provider.
   When the flueframework.com docs and the installed version disagree, trust
   `npx flue docs read <page>`, which ships with the installed version.
3. `wrangler.jsonc` keeps `compatibility_flags: ["nodejs_compat"]` and a
   `compatibility_date` of `2026-04-01` or later.
4. **Every exported capitalized function in a `'use agent'` file becomes an
   agent.** Never export sub-agent functions from it. Define sub-agents in
   `src/subagents/*.ts` with `defineSubagent`.
5. `useModel` is required and called **exactly once** per render. Sub-agents
   cannot call `useModel`, `useSandbox`, or `usePersistentState`. Set `model` on
   the sub-agent definition instead.
6. Use the Workers AI model `cloudflare/@cf/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` (no API keys).
   `cloudflare/...` models only work under `vite dev` or when deployed, not `flue run`.
7. Reserved tool names: `task`, `activate_skill`, `read_skill_resource`, `read`,
   `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `glob`.
8. Tools: validate input with valibot, return `{ output }` or a string, **throw**
   on failure so the model can recover, and pass `signal` to every `fetch`.
   Wikipedia requests need a descriptive `User-Agent` header.
9. Sandbox files (the cp5 container) don't survive a sleep or redeploy. Anything
   that must survive goes in `usePersistentState`. Keep `@cloudflare/sandbox` at
   `0.12.10` (not 1.x) and the `Dockerfile` tag equal to it.
10. Keep Flue pinned to `2.0.0` (with `agents` `0.20.1`). Don't upgrade: 2.1.x
    loses the `chat`/`execute_tool` spans in traces.
11. Never commit `.dev.vars`, `.env`, or secrets.
12. Stay within the attendee's current checkpoint; don't pull later checkpoints'
    code forward.
13. `src/ui/index.html` is given scaffolding. Don't edit it unless the attendee
    asks. It already renders tool calls and any `data-<name>` parts.
